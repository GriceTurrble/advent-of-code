Reversing this, that necessarily means that as we traverse from the edge towards the other end, *every* tree that is taller than all *previous* trees seen in that row is considered visible.\n","\n","Given the second input row (everything in that first row will be visible, too):\n","\n","***0*** ***1*** 111 ***2*** 220220 ***3*** 232333322313 ***4*** 30141411311401124212114133 ***5*** 5234334024414242133303312210313023000021220102\n","\n","- Starting from the left, the `0` is visible, as that's the first tree.\n","- The following `1` is visible, as that's taller than the tallest tree to its left (the `0`); so this one is visible.\n","- The following `1`s are *not* visible: the first `1` is as tall as them.\n","- We keep scanning until we find the next tallest tree, a `2`.\n","- Following that, the next tallest, a `3`, is visible.\n","- Same for the next tallest, a `4`; and again for `5`.\n","\n","So there are 6 trees visible *from the left side* in this line. We can reverse that same process to get trees visible *from the right side*, as well.\n","\n","When we locate each of these instances, we assign coordinates for the point in the map to a set, which neatly excludes duplicates. The final result will the length of that set.\n","\n","Counting left and right is simple: counting up and down is also relatively simple, but to avoid continuously accessing items in the list, it's best to iterate directly on the lists and the strings they contain. To do that, we simply transpose the original inputs with something similar to `list(zip(*inputs))` (the actual method we'll use runs a list comprehension and `\"\".join()` on those resulting tuples of 1-char strings).\n","\n","I also wanted to avoid `range(len())` here, favoring `enumerate()` for performance and convenience of accessing sequence values. Doing that in reverse requires actually reversing the original sequence, so `enumerate(row[::-1])` was used. When this is done, though, the index returned still starts from `0`: to get the real index of the original item (to correctly identify unique coordinates), we need to do `len(row) - 1 - index)`.\n","\n","Accounting for points in the transposed map means simply reversing those points when assigning them to the set. That is, `(x, y)` in the original equates to `(y, x)` in the transposed map.\n","\n","Finally, in actual implementation, we just use some simple nested `for` loops. We can avoid *some* duplication, however, by counting both left and right in sequence inside the same outer loop; and the same for up and down.
