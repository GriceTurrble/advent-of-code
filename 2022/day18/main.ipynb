Each plane is duplicated on both sides, so the number of exposed sides to the outside of the droplet is equal to the number of points on each plane \\* 2.\n","\n","Determining which points are actually on each plane is just a `set` operation: remove one of the coordinates from the points, then add them all to a set, and get the `len()` of that particular set.
