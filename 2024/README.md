# AoC 2024

Welcome to my 2024 solutions for Advent of Code!

This year I have a few goals in mind, so I aim to be busy in this section this month:

- I want to learn more about [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/),
  so I'm writing [Python solutions](python) using `uv` as the main management tool.
- I am starting a new position that involves coding in **Ruby on Rails** and **React**,
  so I want to hone my skills by duplicating solutions in both Ruby and TypeScript.
- I still want to champion a transition to **Rust** in my work,
  so I am also duplicating solutions in Rust.

Seems ambitious, for sure.
Should keep me busy throughout the month. ðŸ™‚

With the advent (heh) of AI tooling, I am making some use of Copilot to assist with the small bits.
I'm not having it actually solve the problem for me, but it's filling in boilerplate and helping me type faster.
