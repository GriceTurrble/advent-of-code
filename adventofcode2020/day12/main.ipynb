    "For this question, part of me wants to design a `Ferry` class that can \"drive\" itself based on a direction provided. Another part of me wants to process the directions in a bulk action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the rules, the directional movements - `N`, `S`, `E`, `W` - are independent of the ship's facing. So those could all be compiled first to give a new starting point. After that, the turns (`R` and `L`) and forward movements (`F`) can be calculated sequentially to adjust the new origin point and arrive at the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, without seeing part 2 yet, we could very well have to change up that algorithm so it uses the original methodology. And making sequential changes to the ship position just processing all the rules in order takes just about as long as trying to bulk change them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, no need to get too smart: just build the `Ferry`, set sail, see where we end up."
