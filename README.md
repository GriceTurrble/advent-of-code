# My Advent of Code answers

My answers and code for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

(I have no affiliation with the AoC).

## ⚠ SPOILERS AHEAD ⚠

These are my **answers** to the puzzles. If you want to solve them yourself, _no peeking!_

You've been warned.

## Probably not my best work.

Don't expect my best code work, but I do try to make _some_ effort in terms of code quality.
