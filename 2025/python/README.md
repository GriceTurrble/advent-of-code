# Solutions for 2025

Solutons in Python for AoC 2025 are posted as Jupyter notebooks.

Any dependencies used across all notebooks are specified using `uv`.
Simply `uv sync` in this folder to get started,
then use the "kernel" in the generated `.venv` directory
to run the notebooks.

> [!note]
> I prefer not to use full Juyter itself,
> instead I open these notebooks in VS Code directly.
> Only the `ipykernel` depdency is required to run them this way.
